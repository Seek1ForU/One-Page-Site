# Over Consideration of the website

Since this webiste is mainly about bushfire, I have decided to utilise colour red as the theme colour in this website. 

and this website is basically linear-narrative based website which operate the website mostly by mouse scrolling as it is easy for reader to view the webite in my perspective. 

# Processing of design

Firstly I have upload an image of bushfire as the background in the home page plus red colour to make it blurred in order to bring more immersive feeling about the website in the first sense, and then i have added a logo about "Australian bush fire" to make it more emphasised about the theme.

Next, I decide to do the side navigation to make it clarified for users to get to know about the each sections of the website in terms of simplicity, etc.

And i added a title in the centre of the home page and also a subtitle which contains the summarised ideas about the website, and i differentiated them by distinct fonts.

And then, i have the following four sections in related to each topics that this website would be covered by, which comprises of "community, mankind, forest and animals". Each sections have a corresponding image and a short paragraph in each of them, and they are divided by the red borders which are also the parts of theme in this website. 

# Chanllenges encountered during coding

In my opinion, the most diffcult parts of the website in terms of coding are 2 animations parts which seems to spend most of time during the coding of side navigation and page jumping. Even though they are quite chanllenging to me, I reckon that they gave more fun to the webiste in terms of providing the user the sense of engaged and interactive participation.
